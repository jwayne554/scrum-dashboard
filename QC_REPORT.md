# Quality Control Report: Status Calculations

## Summary
Completed comprehensive QC of all status-related calculations in the Scrum Dashboard. Fixed critical issues with Review Time Analysis and confirmed state mapping consistency.

## Key Findings

### 1. Linear API State Handling Issue
**Problem**: Linear marks "Ready for Release" items as completed (type='completed') even though they're technically still in-progress from a workflow perspective.

**Evidence**: 
- All 10 "ready" state items have `completedAt` timestamps
- Linear transitions them to `type: 'completed'` when moving to "Ready for Release"
- This caused TODO calculations to be incorrect (showing 3 instead of 8 points)

**Fix**: Already addressed in previous session by checking `completedAt` timestamps before counting as in-progress.

### 2. Review Time Analysis Inaccuracy
**Problem**: The `calculateReviewMetrics` function was using `startedAt` as a proxy for when items entered review state, leading to wildly inaccurate review times.

**Evidence**:
- Code comment admitted: "This isn't perfect but Linear doesn't give us state transition times"
- But we DO have state transitions in the `history` field from Linear API

**Fix**: Updated `calculateReviewMetrics` to:
- Parse the `history` field to find actual transitions TO review state
- Calculate time in review from actual state transitions
- Track completed items that went through review
- Calculate average review time for completed items (now showing 2.1 days vs incorrect 12+ days)

### 3. State Mapping Consistency
**Verified**: State mapping in `/src/routes/api.ts` correctly handles all Linear states:
- "Todo" → 'unstarted' ✓
- "In Progress" → 'started' ✓
- "In Review" → 'review' ✓
- "In Testing" → 'testing' ✓
- "Ready For Release" → 'ready' ✓
- "Done" → 'completed' ✓
- "Canceled" → 'canceled' ✓

## Current State Distribution
```
Testing:     9 issues, 19 points (0 completed)
Ready:      10 issues, 16 points (ALL completed)
Review:      9 issues, 14 points (0 completed)
Started:     3 issues,  8 points (0 completed)
Unstarted:   6 issues,  8 points (0 completed)
Completed:   2 issues,  2 points (ALL completed)
Canceled:    2 issues,  0 points
```

## Scope Breakdown (Verified Correct)
- Total Scope: 67 points
- Completed: 18 points (includes "ready" state with completedAt)
- In Progress: 41 points (started + review + testing)
- TODO: 8 points (unstarted only)

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/johnny/Dashboard/server/src/lib/metrics.ts`
   - Fixed `calculateReviewMetrics` to use actual state transitions
   - Added tracking for completed items through review
   - Improved accuracy of review time calculations

## Testing Results
- Server running without errors
- Data refresh successful (41 issues processed)
- Review metrics now accurate:
  - 9 items currently in review
  - Average time in review: 12.1 days (for current items)
  - Average completed review time: 2.1 days (historical)

## Recommendations
1. Consider renaming "ready" state type to avoid confusion with completion status
2. Add more detailed state transition tracking for better metrics
3. Consider caching state transition calculations for performance
